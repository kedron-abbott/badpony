    <h1> Bad Pony </h1>
    <p> Growing up and finding a place within the bustling city of Sydney is sure to instil in a band a sense of tirelessness and hard work, and it's safe to say Bad Pony are one of, if not the hardest working band in Australia. They just don't stop!</p>
    <p> Since releasing their debut EP 'Limbo' in 2015, the Sydney-based quintet has independently released three self-produced singles, all with national radio success. On the touring front, this premier indie outfit have clocked up thousands upon thousands of kilometres with three national tours since 2015 and an appearance at Music Matters, Singapore 2016.</p>
    <p> Whilst even the most fanatical marathon runner would at least take a moment to stretch out their aching hamstrings, Bad Pony don't seem to show any signs of slowing down. After inking a publishing deal with Perfect Pitch Publishing as well as a booking deal with 123 Agency in 2016, the band have their sophomore EP, 'Deficiency' in the cooker to land into 2017 with a bang. This comes alongside plans to take their award-winning live show across the USA and Canada, with a showcase at Canadian Music Week before returning to their native land for more shows to make 2017 another huge success!</p>

        <p class="wordz">Musically, 'Deficiency' is a leap forward for the band. Balancing grit with glam, the in-ya-face pop-electro confidence is built from a dominant - yet relatively sparse - grinding, mechanical rhythm, that bumps up against a more reflective side ("I'm sick of running out of time"), resembling a introspective nature that's a far better fit for vocalist Jarred Young's soulful tone.</p>

        <p class="wordz">The Sydney electro-rock quintet encompass an abundance of sounds, alluding to bands like Two Door Cinema Club or Foster The People, but with sexy '80s guitar vibes and rhythm that makes you involuntarily move your feet.</p>
